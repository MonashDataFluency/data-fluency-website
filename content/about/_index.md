# About

_Data Fluency_ is a cross-disciplinary initiative by the [Monash University 
Library](https://www.monash.edu/library)
and the [Bioinformatics Platform](http://monash.edu/bioinformatics) aiming to 
build researcher capability at 
Monash. 
Becoming involved in the community will provide you with 
opportunities to develop skills and learn to use tools to explore, interpret 
and visualise big data in a meaningful way and effectively communicate your 
research and ideas. This community of passionate, like-minded Monash 
researchers, graduate researchers and professional staff aims to share 
expertise across disciplines to enhance knowledge of digital research tools, 
and enable you to work smarter, not harder. The community includes novices,
experts, and those in between in learning and teaching through:

 - Software and Data Carpentry workshops on a range of applications such as R and 
   Python, Tableau for data visualisation, Excel for research, MATLAB and GitHub.
 - Software Carpentry instructor training.
 - Community of Practice networking events and seminars.
