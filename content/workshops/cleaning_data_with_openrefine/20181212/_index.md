Got messy data ? Manual data entry with typos ? A spreadsheet that makes Excel grind to a halt ? OpenRefine might just be the tool you need.

This beginner-level hands-on workshop is designed to introduce the basics of working with OpenRefine to clean up, transform and enhance 'messy' datasets. At the conclusion of the workshop you will understand what the OpenRefine software does and how to use it to clean and transform data for your own projects.


#### General Information

This is a hands-on workshop that will be taught in the style of Software Carpentry workshops, following the [Library Carpentry OpenRefine material](https://librarycarpentry.github.io/lc-open-refine/). There will be lots of helpers in the workshop to assist in keeping things on track so that no learner gets lost or left behind !

**Who:** The course is aimed at beginners - no familiarity with data cleaning techniques or OpenRefine is required. You donâ€™t need to have any previous knowledge of the tools that will be presented at the workshop.

**Setup Requirements**: Participants must bring their own laptop (Windows, Mac, Linux) with charger and be able to connect to [eduroam](https://www.monash.edu/esolutions/network/connect-eduroam-wifi). **Please install [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/download.html) on your computer prior to the workshop** - if you have trouble arrive a little early and we can help you get it installed.
