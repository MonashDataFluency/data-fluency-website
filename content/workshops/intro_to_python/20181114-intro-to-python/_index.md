This hands-on workshop aims to equip participants with the fundamentals of programming and give them skills needed to apply data analysis approaches to their research questions.


#### General Information

The workshop will be taught in a similar style to Data Carpentry workshops. [Data Carpentry’s](http://www.datacarpentry.org/) mission is to trains researchers in the core data skills for efficient, shareable, and reproducible research practices.

**Who:** The course is aimed at beginners to programming. You don’t need to have any previous knowledge of the tools that will be presented at the workshop.

**Setup Requirements**: BYO Laptop. No software installation required. The course will be taught online, so active internet connection is required. Tools and material will be provided on the day.

#### Syllabus

[Introduction to Python Workshop](https://monashdatafluency.github.io/python-workshop-base/fullday/) 
(This content is largely based on the Data Carpentry _"Data Analysis and Visualization in Python for Ecologists"_ workshop. There's nothing really ecology-specific about this course, the dataset used just happens to be an ecology-related CSV file)


#### Post-workshop survey

We appreciate your feedback (both positive and negative !) - please fill this out in the last 5 mins of the workshop: https://goo.gl/forms/clw7FfmFjxxAlOGs2
