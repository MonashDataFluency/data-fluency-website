**Who:** The course is aimed at beginners to programming. You don’t need to have any previous knowledge of the tools that will be presented at the workshop.

**Setup Requirements**: BYO Laptop. No software installation required. The course will be taught online, so active internet connection is required. Tools and material will be provided on the day.
