## Introduction to Python Workshop

This hands-on workshop aims to equip participants with the fundamentals of programming and give them skills needed to apply data analysis approaches to their research questions.

#### General Information

The workshop is taught in a similar style to Data Carpentry workshops. [Data Carpentry’s](http://www.datacarpentry.org/) mission is to trains researchers in the core data skills for efficient, shareable, and reproducible research practices.

The course is aimed at beginners to programming. You don’t need to have any previous knowledge of the tools that will be presented at the workshop.

#### Syllabus

(This content is largely based on the Data Carpentry _"Data Analysis and Visualization in Python for Ecologists"_ workshop. There's nothing really ecology-specific about this course, the dataset used just happens to be an ecology-related CSV file)
