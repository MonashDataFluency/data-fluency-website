## Introduction to Tensor Flow and Machine Learning Workshop

-	**Date** :		23rd March 2018
-	**Time** :		1:00pm to 5:00pm
-	**Location** :		L1.04, Sir Louis Matheson Library, Clayton, VIC
-	**Instructor** :	Jason Rigby
-	**Helpers** : 		Shenjun Zhong, Sonika Tyagi


This workshop will cover the basic principles behind the use of TensorFlow, a popular open-source machine learning and general numerical computing framework supported by Google.

#### General Information

The workshop will be taught in a similar style to Data Carpentry workshops. [Data Carpentryâ€™s](http://www.datacarpentry.org/) mission is to trains researchers in the core data skills for efficient, shareable, and reproducible research practices.

**Who:** The course is aimed at graduate students and other researchers. **Basic working python knowledge is required.**

**Setup Requirements**: BYO Laptop. No software installation required. The course will be taught online, so active internet connection is required. Tools and material will be provided on the day.
