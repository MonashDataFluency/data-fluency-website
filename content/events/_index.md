### Next Data Fluency Drop-In Session: Friday 26th Oct, 2pm - 4pm

Location: G19, 15 Innovation Walk (opposite Cinque Lire cafe), Clayton campus.

#### Guest speaker, 2pm

Daniel Buzacott, Manager - Integration, eSolutions, will present Integration at Monash: Getting to the data you need at our next event.

#### Data Fluency Book Club

After the presentation by our guest speaker we will be hosting the Data Fluency Book Club.  In this month's book club we are aiming to finish "R for Data Science", mainly focussing on the section on modelling, Chapters 22-25. Hadley and Garrett have made a very interesting attempt at rendering this important topic intuitive http://r4ds.had.co.nz

Please feel free to share your data images on Slack, and we will show them on the projector during the book club.
