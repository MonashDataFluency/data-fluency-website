### Next Data Fluency Drop-In Session: Friday 31st Aug, 2pm - 4pm

#### Guest speaker

Guest speaker, *Juan Nunez-Iglesias*, Bio Image Analysis Research Fellow from Monash Micro Imaging will present A whirlwind introduction to image analysis in Python at our next event.

*Date and Time:* Friday, August 31st at 2:00 pm in G19, 15 Innovation Walk (opposite Cinque Lire cafe), Clayton campus.

#### Data Fluency Book Club

Immediately after Juan's presentation we will be hosting the Data Fluency Book Club. In this session, we will discuss Chapters 17 - 21 of ["R for Data Science"](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) on programming and data structures. The goal of these chapters is to learn more about the level of programming required to practice data science. We will be discussing the specifics of pipes, functions, vectors, and iteration, which is another tool for reducing code duplication.
 
This session is building toward the next section on models, which gets pretty wild.
 
Please feel free to share your data images on Slack, and we will show them on the projector during the book club.
