### Next Data Fluency Drop-In Session: Friday 22nd Jun, 2pm - 4pm

#### Book Club - R for Data Science (3 pm)

Our ["R for Data Science"](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) book club discussion continues. 
Come sharpen your R skills by discussing the content with R experts in the community.

This time we will be discussing chapter 7 of the book: Exploratory Data Analysis.

Has your data ever surprised you with the story it told? Has visualizing changed how you subsequently analysed or modelled it?
If you have an interesting image to show, share it on Slack and we can put it up on the projector screen.

#### General help session (3 pm onwards, concurrent with book club)

Ask for help (or provide help !) on your current programming or data analysis problems.
