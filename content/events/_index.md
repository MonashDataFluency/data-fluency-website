### Next Data Fluency Drop-In Session: Friday 25th May, 2pm - 4pm

This month we will have a short seminar from Matthew Browne, continue the ["R for Data Science"](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) book club, as well as the usual help session.

#### Seminar - The Democratisation of Data Science (2 pm)
 
**Guest speaker:** Matthew Browne, Data Scientist, Monash University

#### Book Club - R for Data Science (3 pm)

We kicked off the Data Fluency Book Club on 27 April 2018 with the aim of sharpening our R skills by reading 
["R for Data Science"](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. 
The book is available [online](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) and through the Monash University Library.

At the April catch up we read up to chapter 3 of this book.

For the May Book Club discussion, we will look at chapters 4, 5, 6 and 8. These look at the "dplyr" package for data frame manipulation, and how to organize a project in R. (Chapter 7 is a substantial topic, which we will look at in June).

Please come armed with comments, puzzles or challenges presented within the book, and let's have an interesting discussion. Section 5.7 in particular may be a puzzle. If this section makes sense, you have achieved a state of dplyr enlightenment!

#### General help session (3 pm, concurrent with book club)

Ask for help (or provide help !) on your current programming or data analysis problems.
